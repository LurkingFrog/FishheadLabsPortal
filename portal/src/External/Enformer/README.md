# A ReasonReact form builder written in Rescript

Simplify building web forms consistently across a single page app (SPA).

## The problem

Good design says that every common field should exhibit the same behavior. This can generate significant
amounts of boilerplate in the usage and replication. This project is an attempt to simplify form building and
managing with sane defaults to clean things up.
